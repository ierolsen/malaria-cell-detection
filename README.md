# malaria-cell-detection


In this project, I worked on malaria cell dataset of Kaggle. 

These are my own solutions and there are two kind of solutions. One of them, I just created a Convolution Neural Network and 
another one is, I did a Transfer Learning, I chose a Transfer Learning model named ResNet50 for solution.

here is the malaria cell dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
